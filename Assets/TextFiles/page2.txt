Learning Basics

Every password used in Seattle is
coded and compressed by one programme.
It converts every symbol to text. 
For example the word "bin" could be 
encoded like this:
[Decimal]
bin - 98105110
[Hexadecimal]
98105110 - 39 38 31 30 35 31 31 30

As you can see my dear reader, every
symbol in the password is converted
to text, so 9 in ASCII Table changed to
hexadecimal is 39.
You will learn more about different
encoding methods further in the book.

Remember to decompress password first.
